    "tutorial00": "Hello fellow students! Welcome to the Rocketo: Division Videogame!",
    "tutorial01": "Here you will learn about strategies to solve certain kind of division problems such as partitioning division",
    "tutorial02": "My name is Rocketo and I will be your guide throughout the game.",
    "tutorial03": "So, let's start. Before we begin you must understand basic divisions and how to they work.",
    "tutorial04": "The reasoning behind is quite simple, for example on this equation: 6 ÷ 734",
    "tutorial05": "We have to figure out how many groups of 6 does 734 contain.",
    "tutorial06": "To start, let's find a friendly number, a high number multiplied by 6, with an easy number like 100. 6 times 100 equals to 600, so we are getting close.",
    "tutorial07": "Next we substract with our dividiend or original number with 600 and we get 134.",
    "tutorial08": "Then we figure out how many groups of 6 are in 134. Now we think what number can I use to get close to that.",
    "tutorial09": "20 groups of 6 fit into 134, don't forget to substract.",
    "tutorial10": "134 - 120 equals 14. Now how many groups of six fit into 14? the answer is simple, 2.",
    "tutorial11": "Finally we count every group of six we worked so far and add them up. The answer is 122, and we got a remainder of 2.",
    "tutorial12": "Now let's solve a problem with my help. Let's divide 5 ÷ 940.",
    "tutorial13": "Remember, we must get close to 940 using groups of 5 by multiplying a number in multiples of high round numbers, such as 100. (Remember to click the Number Box then type the number on the keyboard)",
    "tutorial14": "Correct! 500 is the closest number to 940.",
    "tutorial15": "So, let's start substracting. 940 - 500 equals?",
    "tutorial16": "Amazing! 440 is the answer!",
    "tutorial17": "Now we find a number closer to 440, since we already used multiplying 5 by 100, we go to the next lower number to fit into.",
    "tutorial18": "Correct! 5 x 80 equals 400 which is the closest to 440.",
    "tutorial19": "Don't forget, now we substract 440 - 400 to continue our division problem.",
    "tutorial20": "Great! 40 is the answer.",
    "tutorial21": "Finally we find the closest number to 40 with groups of 5.",
    "tutorial22": "Great Job! 5 x 8 equals 40.",
    "tutorial23": "Now we add up all groups of 5 used to solve our division.",
    "tutorial24": "Yes we did it! The final answer to the division is 188 with a remainder of 0.",
    "tutorial25": "I think that your are all set to go for our first challenge. This time I will not be there to help you. But I trust that you can do it.",
    "tutorial26": "Let's start with an easy one, solve this division problem: 2 ÷ 24",
    "tutorial27": "Congratulations! It seems you are learning fast! That is the correct answer, now let's move to another problem. Just a bit more challenging!",
    "tutorial28": "Now try to solve the next division problem: 2 ÷ 243",
    "tutorial29": "You are getting pretty good at divisions! That's awesome!",
    "tutorial30": "Remember the first challenge? 2 ÷ 24? Let's make it harder, solve 2 ÷ 2400. Note that is the same reasoning as making the first challenge.",
    "tutorial31": "You did it! Congratulations! See that even if the dividend is 4 digits long, it is related to the 2 digits long problem.",
    "tutorial32": "Let's continue to the next subject: Division Area Models.",
    "tutorial33": "I'll use this example problem to start, 2 ÷ 240.",
    "tutorial34": "Let's start by interpeting this problem into a division area model, make a rectangle where it's total area is the dividend, 240.",
    "tutorial35": "And one side of it's dimensions is 2, and the other dimension is the unknown that we are looking for. ",
    "tutorial36": "So to solve this we must start partitioning or decomposing the dividend (240) into chunks that are divisible by the divisor (2).",
    "tutorial37": "Then using our place value strategies we know that 2 times a hundred will give me 200. But still we need more to build up to the diviend, 240.",
    "tutorial38": "So we move on to tens this time, so we will use 2 chunks of 10 to add up 40. ",
    "tutorial39": "Now that we have the total area divided into chunks, we see that the bottom dimension is the sum of 100 + 10 + 10.",
    "tutorial40": "So the final answer to our division is 120, which is the unknown area we are looking for.",
    "tutorial41": "For our first practice problem we will use area division model to solve: 3 ÷ 366. Don't worry, I will guide you throughout this division problem.",
    "tutorial42": "Remember to visualize a rectangle which it's total area is the same as the dividend (366) and one of it's dimensions is the divisor (3).",
    "tutorial43": "Then we start with a higher number to start multiplying with the divisor to build up to our unknown number such as 100.",
    "tutorial44": "Correct! 300 is the bigger number we need to get closer to our dividend.",
    "tutorial45": "Now we must continue to get closer to the remaining numbers of the dividend, 66. ",
    "tutorial46": "Let's continue with a number close to 66, what would be the next chunk divisible by 3 close to 66? Remember to use numbers multiple by 1 or 10.",
    "tutorial47": "Great! Now we are getting closer, But I believe you need another exact same chunk to build up.",
    "tutorial48": "Awesome! we've tackled 2 groups of 30 which gives us 60.",
    "tutorial49": "Finally we need to figure out how many groups of 3 we need to build up to the remaining numbers of the dividend, 6.",
    "tutorial50": "Great Job! now we still need one more since we only have a 3 left.",
    "tutorial51": "We are almost there! Now that we have all our total area covered it's time to sum it up to get our unknown number.",
    "tutorial52": "You did it! Contratulations! The final answer is 122!",
    "tutorial53": "Now you are ready for the Division Area Model challenges! Don't worry you will start with easy problems first.",
    "tutorial54": "Solve this problem: 3 ÷ 69.",
    "tutorial55": "Allright! You've solved it! The final answer is 23!",
    "tutorial56": "I will ramp up the difficulty just a bit, now solve 4 ÷ 852.",
    "tutorial57": "Awesome! Final answer is 213, you rock!",
    "tutorial58": "And the final division area model problem is: 9 ÷ 1917.",
    "tutorial59": "Great Job! Final answer is 213, same as the previous problem!",
    "tutorial60": "You did it! You passed all main challenges, there is one final challenge mini game. It's completely optional. Do you want to start the final challenge?"
