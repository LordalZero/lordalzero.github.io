    "Tuto1": "Hello fellow students! Welcome to The Incredible Life Machine Videogame.",
    "Tuto2": "Here you will learn how some environmental effects change some organism traits.",
    "Tuto3": "But first we have to remember what is an organism.",
    "Tuto4": "An organism is a form of life composed of mutually interdependent parts that maintain various vital processes, it can be an animal, plant, insect, reptile or even a human being.",
    "Tuto5": "Now, organisms have different traits, think of them as properties, for example the color of the skin, age, gender and so on.",
    "Tuto6": "These traits can be modified over time, by modifying the environment which they grow in.",
    "Tuto7": "Some examples of environmental effects are hot, cold, light, dark or different natural locations.",
    "Tuto8": "Also, these traits can be inherited from their parents, these traits (or characteristics) stem directly from Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.",
    "Tuto9": "A parent organism and its offspring will share similar characteristics, specially the physical ones.",
    "Tuto10": "With that in mind we have created a machine which can emulate different environmental effects over time on different kinds of organisms and the reproduction of organisms.",
    "Tuto11": "Let’s Start!",
    "Tuto12": "First of all let’s take a look on the machine and how to operate it.",
    "Tuto13": "This is the LIFE CYCLE MODULE, here you can grow an ORGANISM from a BABY stage to an ADULT stage and change its ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.",
    "Tuto14": "Here you can adjust the temperature of the environment, it can be a HOT or COLD environment.",
    "Tuto15": "Here you can change the illumination of the environment, it can be a BRIGHT or DARK environment.",
    "Tuto16": "These buttons change the natural location of the environment, it can be a DESERT, FOREST or SNOWY MOUNTAINS.",
    "Tuto17": "You have to select which BABY organism you want to be affected by this environment over time (Until its adulthood)",
    "Tuto18": "Here you can open the organism inventory and select one BABY ORGANISM.",
    "Tuto19": "Finally to make the LIFE CYCLE MODULE work with the selected settings, you have to press this BIG RED BUTTON and the machine will start working.",
    "Tuto20": "The objective of the game is to unlock certain traits on different organisms, to see your progress and list of objectives click on this CLIPBOARD.",
    "Tuto21": "Also the CLIPBOARD contains different features besides the OBJECTIVES, you can check this TUTORIAL again on SETTINGS TAB and see what organisms you have unlocked in the COLLECTIONS TAB.",
    "Tuto22": "If you ran out of BABY ORGANISMS you can make more by switching to the REPRODUCTION MODULE here.",
    "Tuto23": "Now you are ready to go! Good luck on exploring different settings on different organisms, and remember to check the OBJECTIVES or this TUTORIAL again if you feel lost.",
