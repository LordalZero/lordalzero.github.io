    "Tuto1": "Hello fellow students! Welcome to The Incredible Life Machine Videogame.",
    "Tuto2": "Here you will learn how some environmental effects change some organism traits.",
    "Tuto3": "But first, we have to remember the definition of organism.",
    "Tuto4": "An organism is a living thing that can function on its own.  Some examples include plants, insects, reptiles or even human beings.",
    "Tuto5": "Now, organisms have different traits, think of them as properties, for example the color of the skin, age, gender and so on.",
    "Tuto6": "These traits can be modified over time through changes in the organism's environment.",
    "Tuto7": "Some examples of environmental effects are hot, cold, light, dark or different natural locations.",
    "Tuto8": "These traits can be inherited from an organism's parents. The characteristics stem directly from Deoxyribonucleic Acid, or DNA.",
    "Tuto9": "A parent organism and its offspring will share similar characteristics, especially the physical ones.",
    "Tuto10": "With that in mind, we have created a machine that can copy different environmental effects over time.  This can impact different kinds of organisms and the reproduction of organisms.",
    "Tuto11": "Let’s Start!",
    "Tuto12": "First of all, let’s take a look at the machine and how to operate it.",
    "Tuto13": "This is the LIFE CYCLE MODULE.  Here you can grow an ORGANISM from BABY to ADULT stages and change its ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.",
    "Tuto14": "Here, you can adjust the temperature of the environment, making it HOT or COLD.",
    "Tuto15": "Here you can change the illumination of the environment, it can be a BRIGHT or DARK environment.",
    "Tuto16": "These buttons change the natural location of the environment. It can be a DESERT, FOREST or SNOWY MOUNTAINS.",
    "Tuto17": "You have to select which BABY organism you want to be affected by this environment over time (until its adulthood).",
    "Tuto18": "Here you can open the organism inventory and select one BABY ORGANISM.",
    "Tuto19": "Finally to make the LIFE CYCLE MODULE work with the selected settings, you have to press this BIG RED BUTTON and the machine will start working.",
    "Tuto20": "The objective of the game is to unlock certain traits of different organisms. To see your progress and a list of objectives, click on this CLIPBOARD.",
    "Tuto21": "The CLIPBOARD also contains different features besides the OBJECTIVES.  You can check this TUTORIAL again on the SETTINGS TAB and see what organisms you have unlocked in the COLLECTIONS TAB.",
    "Tuto22": "If you run out of BABY ORGANISMS, you can make more by switching to the REPRODUCTION MODULE shown here.",
    "Tuto23": "Now you are ready to go! Good luck on exploring different settings on different organisms, and remember to check the OBJECTIVES or this TUTORIAL again if you feel lost.",
    "Tuto24": "This is the REPRODUCTION MODULE, here you can mate TWO ADULT ORGANISMS to create a NEW BABY ORGANISM.",
    "Tuto25": "Animals and plants share many of the same physical traits with their parents.",
    "Tuto26": "From the beginning, the outward physical characteristics of baby animals and young plants are similar or NEARLY IDENTICAL to their adult parents. (There are exceptions in cases of animals who experience metamorphosis like frogs and butterflies.)",
    "Tuto27": "With that in mind, to start using the REPRODUCTION MODULE you need to know how to operate the module.",
    "Tuto28": "\n \nFirst you need to select TWO available ADULT ORGANISMS from your inventory, in this slot you select the FIRST ADULT ORGANISM.",
    "Tuto29": "\n \nThen you select the SECOND ADULT ORGANISM in this slot.",
    "Tuto30": "This is the MESSAGE BOARD, here you can see if both organisms are compatible to mate, this is a requirement to make the module work.",
    "Tuto31": "You NEED to have both organism of the same NAME and different GENDERS (Male and Female) on both of the module’s slots for the machine to work.",
    "Tuto32": "There's a little exception, for flowers you just need to select ONE organism and the panel will automatically change.",
    "Tuto33": "When you are ready to mate both organisms selected or ONE flower, press this BIG RED BUTTON.",
    "Tuto34": "This module is limited, it ONLY produces ONE offspring out of mating TWO adult organisms at a time.",
    "Tuto35": "Remember, you can switch back to the LIFE CYCLE MODULE here.",
    "Tuto36": "Now you are ready to go, remember to ALWAYS check out your OBJECTIVES TAB in the CLIPBOARD to check your progress towards the completion of the game.",
